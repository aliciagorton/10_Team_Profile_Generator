# 10_Team_Profile_Generator
# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

* Here we have a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. While, also ensuring that all unit tests pass.

## As a manager you will be able: 
* To generate a webpage that displays your team's basic info
* Have quick access to team's emails and GitHub profiles
* Engineer's will have github listed 
* Intern's will have school listed 
* When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

### Directory structure:

```
lib/           // classes and helper code
output/        // rendered output
templates/     // HTML template(s)
test/          // jest tests
  Employee.test.js
